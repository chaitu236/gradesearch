Grade information is taken from <a href=http://registrar.tamu.edu/facultystaff/report/default.aspx>http://registrar.tamu.edu/facultystaff/report/default.aspx</a>
<br>
Only courses from Business Administration, Engineering, Science, Architecture can be searched for now (talk to me if you'd like some course to be added)
<br>
DB contains info from 2009 fall to 2015 fall
<br>
Didn't add info before 2009 fall as the pdf's format is different
<br>
<br>
Code is available at <a href=https://github.com/chaitu236/gradesearch>https://github.com/chaitu236/gradesearch</a>
<br>
DB is also available if you want to do advanced queries on the data
<br>
<br>
There is no guarantee of any kind for this app.
If it kills your cat, don't blame me
